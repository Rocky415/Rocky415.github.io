  <h1>Pneumatic Exoskeleton</h1>
  <p>This device amplifies my bicep/tricep movements through a pneumatic cylinder located behind my tricep. Here is a video that shows the exoskeleton lifting a 24kg weight:</p>

  <p>The exoskeleton is able to lift 24kg of weight on its own. I am trying my best to completely relax my arm in this video, although it is not perfect. I have a journal pending publication at Columbia Junior Science Journal. I will link it here after publication. It details the experimentation, material selection and design of this prototype.</p>
  <p><strong>Development Process:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Material strength testing was done on polylactic acid(PLA), polyethylene terephthalate(PET) and polycarbonate(PC). The majority of the paper I wrote is about this. Through this process, polycarbonate was determined to be the strongest and safest option, thus chosen for this prototype. It also has the added benefit of being very lightweight.</li>
    <li>Pneumatics was decided to be the power system of the exoskeleton. After extensive research, I realized that electric motors were too heavy, too weak and hard to build with. Pneumatics provided a stronger and easier option as a power system. Although it doesn't offer the precision movements of an electric system, it makes up for it in price, weight and strength. It does have to be connected to an air tank though.</li>
    <li>I still needed to find a way to use the exoskeleton. After some research, I realized I could use electromyography(EMG) sensors to interface with it. EMG sensors translated electrical signals from my muscles to commands for external hardware, essentially extending my nervous system to the exoskeleton. This feature was not implemented yet, but will be soon and I will post the final result on here. Below is an animation/visualization of the EMG sensor detection process.</li>
